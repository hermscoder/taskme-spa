That a single page application, developed in angular, pointing to a Java Rest API on heroku, that is on my github as well (taskme-app).If you want to check the result till now, check the website (maybe it will take time to load, because of the heroku initialization).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.1.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
